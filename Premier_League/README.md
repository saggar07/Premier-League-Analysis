# Premier-League-Player-Performance-Analysis


## 🧾 Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth analysis of Premier League player-level performance data, sourced from a regularly updated Kaggle dataset. The objective is to evaluate and compare player performances across clubs and positions using key football metrics such as goals, assists, minutes played, and other on-field contributions.

Using Python-based data analysis techniques, the project focuses on cleaning raw statistical data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating meaningful visualizations to uncover trends, standout performers, and performance patterns. Special emphasis is placed on per-90 metrics and positional comparisons to ensure fair and context-aware evaluation of players with varying playtime.

The analysis aims to replicate real-world sports analytics workflows, similar to those used by clubs, analysts, and media teams, and demonstrates how raw match data can be transformed into actionable insights for performance evaluation, scouting, and decision-making.
